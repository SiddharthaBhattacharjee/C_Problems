# C_Problems
Solving the C challenge problems from our college competitive programming website. I will do it every once in a while in between my major ongoing coding topic, It is a part of #100DaysOfCode Challenge.<br>

### Day1 : 
Problems solved = 7, problems attempted = 10, progress = level-1 7%, Rank = 148.<br>

### Day2 :
problrms solved = 19, problems attempted = 20, progress = (level-1 11% : level-2 8%), Rank = 144<br>

### Day3 :
problrms solved = 23, problems attempted = 20, progress = (level-1 11% : level-2 10% level-3: 2%), Rank = 140<br>

###Day4:
problrms solved = 30, problems attempted = 32, progress = (level-1 11% : level-2 10% level-3: 9%), Rank = 135<br>

###Day5:
problrms solved = 39, problems attempted = 40, progress = (level-1 20% : level-2 10% level-3: 9%), Rank = 131<br>

###Day6:
problrms solved = 44, problems attempted = 45, progress = (level-1 20% : level-2 15% level-3: 9%), Rank = 126<br>
